# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview


Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:


1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Mayya-7308/XM32U98Y?sharingId=3A629E25F8F9040C)
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/Mayya-7308/UY5XDSA3?sharingId=3A629E25F8F9040C)


## Reflections
1. After first module completion I learned why TypeScript was created, how to use and install it, how ts file compiles to js file and what do we need for it. I installed TypeScript and tried to use it in work.
2. After "Declare Variable Types in TypeScript" module completion I learned the advantages of declaring typed variables in TypeScript and I knew that there are primitive types, object types, union and intersection types in TypeScript. I completed the Lab 'Use types in TypeScript', practised use types for variables.
